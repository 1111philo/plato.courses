                                Our courses are built for reflection. Most programs teach skill after skill and assume a career will follow. But we've found that people hold onto jobs longer when they know <em>who they are</em>, not just what they last learned &mdash; tools come and go, the person using them stays. That's why every lesson pairs technical work with reflection, on purpose.
