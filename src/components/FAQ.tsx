            question: "How is this different from a bootcamp?",
            answer: "Courses are reflective by design. Bootcamps optimize for the day you get hired; we optimize for the years after. In our experience, people keep jobs longer when they've established who they are than when they're showcasing a stack of newly learned skills — so self-knowledge is built into the curriculum alongside the technical work."
